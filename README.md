# Loading Animation with Blurring Effect
This repository creates a loading animation with a blurring effect.
The animation gradually increases the loading percentage and applies a blur effect to the background. 
It's a lightweight and customizable solution that you can integrate into your web projects.
This effect can be useful in a few of these scenarios:

**Form Submission**:

When a user submits a form that requires server processing, you can display this animation to signify that the form submission is being processed.
It assures users that their action is being taken into account and helps manage their expectations during the waiting period.

**Page Transitions**:

During page transitions, such as switching between different sections or pages within a single-page application, applying this loading animation with a blurring effect can provide a seamless visual transition.
It keeps the user engaged while the new content is being loaded or rendered.
